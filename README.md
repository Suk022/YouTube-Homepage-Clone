# Project Overview
This is a clone of the YouTube main page that I created while learning HTML and CSS. The page mimics the layout and design of YouTube, including the navigation bar, search bar, and a grid of 12 video thumbnails
# Purpose

Structuring content using HTML.
Styling pages using CSS, including flexbox and grid.
Creating a visually appealing, responsive layout.
